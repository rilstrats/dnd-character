This file was just to help me figure out what classes would use which principles of Object Oriented Programming

Inheritance
    Inheriting from other classes (fulfilled by action, action prepare dice, action prepare game, and action prepare character)

Abstraction
    Abstract classes that you use to make other classes (fulfilled by ability and dice)

Polymorphism
    Using the same method name in different classes so that you can use a for loop instead of if logic (fulfilled by dice, ability, character, action prepare dice, and controll gui)

Encapsulation
    Hiding information, using getters and setters (fulfilled by ability and character)
