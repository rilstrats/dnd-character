# D&amp;D Character Sheet
A custom D&amp;D Character Sheet and Dice Roller. Maybe even a couple rounds of combat just for fun.

## General
This program will be developed in Python 3.9.7 and to play you will need to download Python 3. For ease of explanation and natural separation, this project will be broken down into three parts.
* Character Sheet
* Dice Roller
* Encounters

### Character Sheet
This will have all the basics. It will keep track of all 6 of the basic ability scores and modifiers, proficiency bonus, level (I might even add some equipment and AC to the mix). It will have the option to store this information in a json format. It will also be able to open a json file, and modify the ability scores.

### Dice Roller
This will be a glorified random number generator. I will set up different dice options you can roll (d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) and set up overloading so that the proficiency and attribute modifiers can be passed in to add those values to the roll.

### Encounters
This will be the most complex part of the program. I will have three encounters set up (easy, medium, and hard). I'm not sure how the combat will work yet, but we'll get there when I get there. Maybe I'll have mouse input, so you can click on who to attack and what to roll. (I haven't even thought of how to make spells yet, so I'm not sure how those will end up or if they'll even be included)
